# Kombino - Terms, Conditions and Privacy Policy

## Terms & Conditions

Santtu Hyvärinen built the Kombino game as a Free game. This SERVICE is provided by Santtu Hyvärinen at no cost and is intended for use as is.

By downloading or using the game, these terms will automatically apply to you - you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the game. You're not allowed to copy, or modify the game, any part of the game, or our trademarks in any way. You're not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the game, and you also shouldn't try to translate the game into other languages, or make derivative versions. The game itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Santtu Hyvärinen.

You should be aware that there are certain things that Santtu Hyvärinen will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the game will require the game to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Santtu Hyvärinen cannot take responsibility for the game not working at full functionality if you don't have access to Wi-Fi, and you don't have any of your data allowance left.

With respect to Santtu Hyvärinen's responsibility for your use of the game, when you're using the game, it's important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Santtu Hyvärinen accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the game.

At some point, we may wish to update the game. The game is currently available on Android - the requirements for system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the game to) may change, and you'll need to download the updates if you want to keep playing the game. Santtu Hyvärinen does not promise that it will always update the game so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the game when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the game, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the game, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
